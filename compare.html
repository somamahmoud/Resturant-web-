               <p>When you're having a bad day, science says you shouldn't automatically collapse on the couch; it might be a better idea to break out the recipe books. The emotional benefits of cooking are myriad; many programs around the world help people with mood disorders and other issues get into the kitchen as part of their treatment, a practice known as <span>"therapeutic cooking."</span> And it's something you can replicate in your own home, with a bit of effort and an ingredient or two.</p><p>More like this

               <h3 >Nutrients and Calories in food</h3>
               <p>HealthNutritionRelating Calories to Nutrients in the Food You Eat Relating Calories to Nutrients in the Food You Eat By Jane Kirby, The American Dietetic Association Calories are simply a way to measure the energy in food and the energy released in the body. Although the technically correct name is kilocalorie, everyone, including dietitians, uses the shorter<span> “calorie.”</span>One calorie is the amount of energy necessary to raise the temperature of<span> 1 gram of water by 1 degree Centigrade</span>. You expend about <span>1 calorie per minute </span>when sitting relaxed. That’s about the same amount of heat released by a candle or a<span> 75-watt</span> light bulb.Calories are rounded on food labels, so when you multiply the grams of protein, carbohydrate, or fat, you may come out with a different value than appears on the label. Foods that contain <span>50 </span>calories or fewer are rounded to the nearest<span> 5-calorie</span> increment; foods with more than <span>50 </span>calories are rounded to the nearest <span>10-calorie</span> increment.Foods that have fewer than<span> 5 </span>calories can be listed as having <span>0 </span>calories. Although you may think that this rounding seems misleading or inaccurate, keep in mind that a<span> 10-calorie</span> difference is actually negligible in the grand scheme of things.A calorie isn’t a nutrient, but certain nutrients provide calories. Protein, carbohydrate, and fat make up the calorie contents of various foods. Although not considered a nutrient, alcohol also provides calories.</p>

               <h3 class="head">General information</h3>
               <p class="head">Fruits are a good source of vitamins and minerals, recognized for their role in preventing vitamin C and vitamin A deficiencies. People who incorporate fruits and vegetables as part of a healthy eating pattern have a reduced risk of some chronic diseases. USDA's MyPlate encourages filling half of the plate with fruits and vegetables at mealtimes.Fruits are an important part of a healthy eating pattern and the source of many vital nutrients, including potassium, folate (folic acid), and antioxidants including polyphenols. Fruit such as blueberries, cranberries, strawberries and citrus also contain phytochemicals that are being studied for their added health benefits.  </p>

               <p class="head1">In order to encourage retail stores that sell raw fruits, vegetables, and fish to participate in the voluntary point-of-purchase nutrition information program (21 CFR 101.42 through 101.45), FDA has created downloadable posters for printing.These posters show nutrition information for the 20 most frequently consumed raw fruits, vegetables, and fish in the United States.Retail stores are welcome to download the posters, print, display and/or distribute them to consumers in close proximity to the relevant foods in the stores.The list of food items with nutrition information reflects the updates published in the Federal Register of August 17, 2006 (71 FR 47439).FDA also encourages consumers to view the posters. A text (html) version is also available for online viewing.To print posters, please select the poster size that is appropriate for your printer.</p>
